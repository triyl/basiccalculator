# basiccalculator
First HTML/JS project

Trying to dust off the coding skillz and learn a few new things. This initial project is a little html calculator styled a bit with some (very) basic CSS

If anyone happens to see this and has any comments (seemingly obvious or otherwise) I would appreciate it. Just trying to learn as much as fast as possible, to try and start a new career path.
